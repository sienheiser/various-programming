# Problem
## a) Entity and architecture
In this problem we will make a flipflop that has ports (clk,D,Q) 
where clk is the clock, D is an input bit and Q is an output bit.

We want this flipflop to have the following behaviour. Everytime
the clock has a rising edge update the value of Q to the current 
value of D.

## Test bench
We want a test bench using vhdl and cocotb. Run the test bench and check
that your code works.
