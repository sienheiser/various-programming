# Problem
In this problem you should construct a shift_register with four d_ff.
## Entity
We should construct two entities 
1. The d_ff entity.
2. The shift_register entity.

## Architecture
The d_ff entity has a behavioural architecture. The shift_register entity
has a structural architecture purely composed of d_ff.

## Testbench
Made a testbench and check how the long it takes for the output to register 
your input. Try to understand why is that so.
