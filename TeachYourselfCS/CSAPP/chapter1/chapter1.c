// Chapter1.1 Information is bits + context
// Given a sequence of bytes, the meaning of those bytes change depending on how we decode them


// Chapter1.2 Programs are translated by other programs into different forms
// For a computer to run a source file it must be translated into machine code. What is interesting
// is that the source file is a text file which is a sequence of bytes; machine code is also a sequence of bytes.
// To translate the source file into machine code we use a compilation system which is a collection of programs
//               translation_1           translation_2
// source_file ----------------> file_1 ----------------> file2 --------------->......
