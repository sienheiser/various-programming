# Problem
In this problem we will learn how to describe an entity
structurally. 

## d_ff
Define an entity d_ff that takes in two inputs and has one 
output. One input is for a clock and the other is just 
a binary input. The output must equal the input on the
rising_edge of the clock.

Write a test bench for this entity to check that it works.

## and2
Define an entity called and2 that takes two inputs and has 
one output. One input is for a clock and the other is an 
enable input. The output must be the clock when enable is
'1' otherwise the output put must be zero.

Write a test bench for this entity to check that it works. 


## reg1
Define an entity called reg1 that takes three inputs and has
one output.

The three inputs are a clock, enable and a binary value. The
output is equal to the input binary value.

Define the architecture of this entity using components d_ff 
and2.

Write a test bench for this entity to check that it works.
